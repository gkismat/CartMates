CARTMATES – COLLABORATIVE SHOPPING CART PLATFORM

A collaborative e-commerce cart system enabling users to manage a shared shopping cart, provide real-time feedback, and receive AI-powered purchase recommendations.

Frontend: Built using a modified Bootstrap template for a responsive UI.
Backend: Python Flask API using Hugging Face Transformers (sentiment analysis) and OpenAI Whisper (voice transcription, adapted and modified).
Realtime Features: Firebase for synchronization and cloud storage.

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1. CLONE THE REPOSITORY

git clone [https://github.com/gkismat/CartMates.git](https://github.com/gkismat/CartMates.git)
cd CartMates

2. FIREBASE SETUP

* Go to Firebase Console: [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
* Create a new project, enable Firestore Database and Storage
* Update collaborator/firebase-config.js with your Firebase credentials
  Example format:
  const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
  };
* Set Firestore and Storage rules as needed (for demo, allow read/write for all)

3. BACKEND (FLASK) SETUP

* Create and activate a virtual environment:
  On Mac/Linux:
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  On Windows:
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
* Install Python dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
* Run the backend:
  python app.py
* The backend runs at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

4. FRONTEND SETUP

* cd FashionStore-pro
* python3 -m http.server 8000
* Open [http://localhost:8000/products.html](http://localhost:8000/products.html) for the main store, or other HTML files as needed

---

USAGE FLOW

1. Add products: Browse and add products via products.html
2. View cart: See your selections in cart.html
3. Collaborator feedback: Open collaborator/collaborator\_card.html on another device or window, provide feedback using text, emoji, or voice
4. AI suggestions: Receive instant "Buy" or "Skip" popups based on reactions

---

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

DATA FLOW

* Products are added to cart and stored in localStorage plus Firebase
* Collaborator reacts to products, reactions stored in Firebase
* AI system analyzes reactions and generates suggestions
* User receives suggestions and makes informed decisions

REAL-TIME SYNC

* Firebase Firestore: Real-time database updates for cart and reactions
* Storage: Firebase Storage for audio files
* Web APIs: For voice recording and playback

AI SUGGESTION ALGORITHM

* Model: Pre-trained Hugging Face Transformers for sentiment analysis (inference only)
* Voice: OpenAI Whisper used for speech-to-text (reference code, adapted for project)
* Recommendation Logic: Positive sentiment plus positive emojis means "Buy"; negative means "Skip"

TROUBLESHOOTING

* Voice recording not working: Check browser microphone permissions
* Reactions not syncing: Verify Firebase configuration
* Cart not updating: Check localStorage and browser console for errors
* AI suggestions not showing: Ensure Flask backend is running and dependencies are installed

---

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

* User authentication system
* Multiple collaborator support
* Advanced AI with continuous learning
